# <Zachary-Barnes-Portfolio>

## Description

I created a landing page for all things related to my work.  
Within my portfolio you'll find one of my projects, and a few fillers for future projects that I look forward to tackling.  
The navigation bar at the top can bring you across my Portfolio to specific areas.  
Down at the bottom of the page, my contact information is listed for your ability to reach me multiple ways.
